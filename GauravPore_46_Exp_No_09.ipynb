        "Theory : Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a standard NLP problem which involves spotting named entities (people, places, organizations etc.) from a chunk of text, and classifying them into a predefined set of categories. Some of the practical applications of NER include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Scanning news articles for the people, organizations and locations reported.\n",
        "\n",
        "Providing concise features for search optimization: instead of searching the entire content, one may simply search for the major entities involved.\n",
